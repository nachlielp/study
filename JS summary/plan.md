Great—here’s a focused 3‑day plan (5 hours/day) to prep specifically for a JavaScript test. Each day uses five 55‑minute focus blocks with 5–10 minute breaks. Emphasis is on core JS, async, DOM, and interview‑style coding tasks.

Before you start (one‑time, 20–30 minutes today)

- Environment: VS Code + Prettier, Node LTS, a browser (Chrome).
- Folder structure: 01-core, 02-async-dom, 03-mock.
- Create a scratchpad.js for quick experiments and a notes.md for your own “cheat sheet.”
- Bookmark MDN and javascript.info.

Day 1 — Core language mastery
Goal: Be rock‑solid on language fundamentals and common coding drills.

Session 1 (55m): Scope, closures, this, call/apply/bind

- Study: lexical scope, closure use cases, function vs arrow this, call/apply/bind.
- Drills:
  - Build a counter using closures with methods inc, dec, value.
  - Implement once(fn) wrapper.
  - Re‑implement bind polyfill (basic).

Session 2 (55m): Prototypes, classes, object model

- Study: prototype chain, Object.create, Object.getPrototypeOf, classes, private fields.
- Drills:
  - Polyfill instanceof (myInstanceOf).
  - Implement a simple class hierarchy with method override and super.
  - Implement new operator behavior (myNew).

Session 3 (55m): Arrays, objects, immutability

- Study: map/filter/reduce, sort comparators, Set/Map, shallow vs deep copy.
- Drills:
  - groupBy(arr, keyOrFn).
  - unique(arr) using Set and a variant for objects by key.
  - flatten(arr, depth) and flattenDeep(arr).
  - deepClone with a structuredClone fallback and a JSON fallback trade‑offs note.

Session 4 (55m): Types, coercion, equality, errors

- Study: primitives vs objects, truthy/falsy, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, try/catch/finally, custom Error.
- Drills:
  - safeGet(obj, path, defaultValue).
  - parseNumber(str) robustly (handle commas, NaN).
  - Implement deepMerge(objA, objB).

Session 5 (55m): Algorithm warm‑ups (arrays/strings)

- Do 4–6 timed problems: two‑sum style \(O(n)\), longest substring without repeat \(O(n)\), anagram check \(O(n)\), merge intervals \(O(n \log n)\), binary search \(O(\log n)\).
- Time cap: 15–20 min each; write clean code and quick tests.

Deliverables end of Day 1

- Your notes on closures/this/prototypes.
- Utility functions implemented: once, myBind, myInstanceOf, myNew, groupBy, unique, flatten, deepClone, deepMerge.

Day 2 — Async, event loop, DOM, browser APIs
Goal: Be fluent in async and show practical browser skills.

Session 1 (55m): Event loop, microtasks vs macrotasks, Promises

- Study: task queues, microtask ordering, Promise states.
- Drills:
  - Predict console.log order puzzles.
  - Implement sleep(ms), timeoutPromise(p, ms).
  - Polyfill promiseAll and promiseAllSettled.
  - Concurrency limiter: limit(fnArray, k).

Session 2 (55m): Fetch, HTTP, CORS, AbortController

- Study: fetch basics, headers, status handling, JSON, CORS preflight, AbortController.
- Drills:
  - fetchJSON(url, { signal }) with error normalization.
  - fetchWithRetry(url, { retries, backoff }), exponential backoff.
  - Cache layer with Map + TTL.
  - Debounce and throttle utilities (leading/trailing options).

Session 3 (55m): DOM, events, forms, delegation

- Study: querySelector, classList, dataset, event propagation/bubbling/capture, delegation, preventDefault.
- Drills:
  - Build a small Todo list: add/remove/toggle using event delegation on a parent.
  - Accessible keyboard interactions for buttons/links.
  - Minimize layout thrash; use requestAnimationFrame for batched UI updates.

Session 4 (55m): Web storage + security basics

- Study: localStorage/sessionStorage, cookies vs storage, XSS basics, innerHTML vs textContent, sanitization overview, CSP idea.
- Drills:
  - Store/retrieve user settings with localStorage (with JSON try/catch).
  - Show how a naive innerHTML can be exploited; fix by using textContent or a sanitizer.

Session 5 (55m): Mini‑mock (timed)

- 60 minutes: 1 async coding task + 5–8 short theory questions.
  - Example coding: implement promiseAny, or write fetchWithRetry + AbortController.
  - Theory: event loop order, CORS vs same‑origin, capturing vs bubbling, difference between \(==\) and \(===\).

Deliverables end of Day 2

- Utilities: debounce, throttle, promiseAll/AllSettled/Any, concurrency limiter, fetchWithRetry, cache with TTL.
- A small DOM project (Todo with delegation).
- Notes on event loop, CORS, storage, and XSS mitigations.

Day 3 — Patterns, performance, Node/tooling, full mock
Goal: Tie it together, practice interview‑style tasks, polish.

Session 1 (55m): Node basics and tooling

- Study: ESM vs CJS, package.json scripts, npm, environment vars, basic file I/O.
- Drill:
  - Write a tiny CLI script: read JSON file, transform, write output.
  - Quick Jest or Node’s assert tests for utilities.

Session 2 (55m): Patterns you can implement quickly

- Study: module pattern, revealing module, pub/sub vs EventEmitter, currying, compose/pipe, immutability patterns.
- Drills:
  - EventEmitter with on/off/once/emit.
  - curry(fn) and compose(...fns).
  - LRU cache (Map + doubly‑linked logic or simple Map + array for small size).

Session 3 (55m): Performance, memory, debugging, Big‑O

- Study: Chrome DevTools Sources/Network/Performance; common perf pitfalls (innerHTML in loops, unnecessary reflows), memory leaks (dangling listeners, closures), WeakMap/WeakSet.
- Drills:
  - Optimize a nested loop to \(O(n)\) with a Map.
  - Refactor a DOM loop to batch updates.
  - Use breakpoints and logpoints in DevTools.
- Big‑O recap: \(O(1)\), \(O(\log n)\), \(O(n)\), \(O(n \log n)\), \(O(n^2)\).

Session 4 (90m): Full mock test (timed)

- 2 coding tasks (choose two):
  - Deep flatten with depth arg and circular reference protection.
  - Implement Promise.any (or limit concurrency).
  - Event delegation mini‑app: interactive list with filters and debounced search.
  - LRU cache with get/put and capacity.
- 10–15 rapid‑fire questions:
  - Hoisting rules, TDZ, this binding rules, prototypes vs **proto**.
  - Microtask vs macrotask examples.
  - CORS: what triggers preflight? How to avoid?
  - Differences between null/undefined; optional chaining vs nullish coalescing.
  - Why use WeakMap? Example.

Session 5 (35m): Review and cheat sheet

- Summarize patterns, pitfalls, and code snippets you’re most likely to need.
- Create a one‑page checklist:
  - Closures/this/prototypes/class fields, destructuring, rest/spread, map/filter/reduce, Set/Map, equality/coercion rules, error handling patterns, event loop truths, fetch + AbortController, debounce/throttle signatures, storage, XSS hygiene.
- 20 minutes: speak through one solved problem out loud as if interviewing.

Recommended references (use during plan)

How to use each 55‑minute block

- 5 min: Scan notes/examples.
- 35–40 min: Hands‑on coding.
- 5–10 min: Self‑check and quick tests.
- 5 min: Write 3–5 flashcards from what you learned.

What interviewers often test (make sure you can explain quickly)

- Closures and practical uses (encapsulation, memoization).
- this binding rules; arrow vs function.
- Prototypes vs classes, inheritance mechanics.
- Array methods and when to use which; stable sorting with custom comparator.
- Event loop ordering; microtasks vs macrotasks; async/await error handling.
- Debounce vs throttle and when to use each.
- DOM event delegation; preventDefault vs stopPropagation.
- Fetch + AbortController; basic CORS.
- Security basics: avoid unsafe innerHTML.
- Big‑O for your solutions: be ready to say \(O(n)\), \(O(n \log n)\), etc.

Want me to generate a 90‑minute mock test (with solutions) and a printable one‑page cheat sheet from this plan? If you share whether the role leans frontend (React) or full‑stack (Node), I’ll tailor the mock and emphasis.
