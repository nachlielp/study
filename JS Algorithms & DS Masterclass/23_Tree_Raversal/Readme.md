Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure, in a specific order. There are three common ways to traverse a tree:

A. Breadth-first search (BFS): This visits all the sibling nodes at the same level before moving to the next level.

B. Depth-first search (DFS): This drills down/up the tree based on values

DFS has 3 types:

1. In-order traversal: This visits the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree.
2. Pre-order traversal: This visits the current node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
3. Post-order traversal: This visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.
