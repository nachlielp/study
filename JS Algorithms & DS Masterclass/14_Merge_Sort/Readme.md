# Merge Sort

The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer technique. It is a stable sorting algorithm. The algorithm divides the input into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them. The merge sort algorithm is efficient for large data sets.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Divide the input into two halves.
2. Recursively sort the two halves.
3. Merge the two sorted halves.

The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n).
