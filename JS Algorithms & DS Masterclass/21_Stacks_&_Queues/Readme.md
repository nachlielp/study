A stack has the following methods:

- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack
- Pop: Removes an element from the top of the stack
- Peek: Returns the top element of the stack
- isEmpty: Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise

## Queue

A queue has the following methods:

- Enqueue: Adds an element to the end of the queue
- Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue
- Peek: Returns the front element of the queue
