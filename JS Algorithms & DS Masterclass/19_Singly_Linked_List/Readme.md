## Singly linked list

A singly linked list is a type of linked list where each node points to the next node in the list.

The list has a head, tail, and length property.

The head property is the first node in the list.
The tail property is the last node in the list.
The length property is the number of nodes in the list.

head -> X -> Y -> Z -> null

Trimming a linked list is much more efficient than trimming an array, all you do is change the head or tail and length property.
Inserting a node is more efficient than inserting into an array, all you do is change the head and length property.
