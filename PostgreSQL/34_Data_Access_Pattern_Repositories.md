## Repository Pattern

The repository pattern is a design pattern that provides a way to access data from a database.

It is a layer of abstraction between the application and the database, kind of a service layer.

Our example for this is the [user-repo.js](../PostgreSQL/api/social-repo/src/repos/user-repo.js) file that we call from the [routes/users.js](../PostgreSQL/api/social-repo/src/routes/users.js) file.
