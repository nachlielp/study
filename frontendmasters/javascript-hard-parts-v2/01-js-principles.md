- thred of execution - top to bottom
  - saves data into memory
  - add to execution context - the call stack
- execution context - when running a function, a new execution context is created with a new variable environment
  - notice that when running a loop, its its own name space, but not its own execution context
- call stack - keeps track of the execution context (at the base of the stack is the global execution context)
